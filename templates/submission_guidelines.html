<p>When submitting your test results, please adhere to the following instructions.</p>

<p>Firstly, the results you submit must be in a JSON file. All results in the JSON file should be stored as a list, with each element in the list being a dictionary, following this format:.</p>

<p>Secondly, due to the large size of the JSON file that needs to be provided, we highly recommend using the Command Line Interface (CLI) to submit the results, as other methods may encounter difficulties in successful submission. When using the CLI to submit the file, you will be prompted with 'Do you want to include the Submission Details?', you <strong>must</strong> answer 'y' to this, and further specify the <strong>'Method Name'</strong> (choose either 'Supervised' or 'OVD'; it is critical to provide the correct metric, as an incorrect entry will result in <strong>evaluation failure</strong>). Other information can be optionally provided or omitted.</p>

<p>Finally, the evaluation process may take up to half an hour. If there is a high volume of user submissions, it might take longer. Please be patient and monitor the progress in the 'My Submissions' section.</p>
