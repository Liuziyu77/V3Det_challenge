<!-- <h4>Dataset Overview</h4>
<p>We introduce V3Det, a vast vocabulary visual detection dataset meticulously crafted to advance the field of general visual object detection. This dataset addresses the challenge of detecting arbitrary objects in real-world scenarios, where traditional object detection datasets are often limited by their relatively restricted vocabulary. </p>

<p>V3Det stands out with its extensive range of features:</p>

<p><strong>Vast Vocabulary:</strong> It encompasses bounding boxes for objects across 13,204 categories in real-world images. This scale is ten times larger than any existing large vocabulary object detection dataset, like LVIS, setting a new benchmark in dataset size and diversity.</p>

<p><strong>Hierarchical Category Organization:</strong> The categories in V3Det are thoughtfully arranged in a hierarchical category tree. This structure not only delineates the inclusion relationships among different categories but also fosters an exploration into the complex interconnections and relationships within vast and open vocabulary object detection scenarios.</p>

<p><strong>Rich Annotations:</strong> The dataset includes 243k images, each precisely annotated with bounding boxes to ensure accurate object identification and localization. Furthermore, V3Det offers professional descriptions for each category, crafted by human experts. This level of detail aids significantly in the interpretation and understanding of the dataset.</p>

<p>V3Det is more than just a dataset; itâ€™s an exploration space that allows for comprehensive benchmarks in both vast and open vocabulary object detection. Itâ€™s poised to yield new observations, practices, and insights, thereby contributing to future research in the field. With its expansive scope and detailed annotations, V3Det is uniquely positioned to be a cornerstone dataset for the development of more generalized visual perception systems.</p>
